# Google Maps API Integration, Flutter Project

Hack The North East Hackathon January 2021 Project, Dillon Bendig
*This is only my portion of the project*

This is my work devoted to my group's "Covid Spy" application for HTNE 2021
I was in charge of learning how to implement the Google Cloud Maps API into a
mobile Android application. In terms of development I used Android Studios as an
IDE and also took advantage of their built in Android emulators for testing.
The project also primarily used Flutter, thus it was coded almost completely in Dart.
Prior to the hackathon, I had never even heard of Flutter, and I had barely used Android Studios (I had also never worked with Google Cloud APIs), so it was a great learning experience. That being said, there are allot of rough edges to my demo, and my portion of the project was primarily functionality as others focused on UI design and presentation. I may polish and add to this simple demo in the future, as I did find it both fun and interesting.
